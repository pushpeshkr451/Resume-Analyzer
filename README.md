Resume Analyzer with AI üöÄ
This project is a smart web application designed to give job seekers a significant advantage by analyzing their resume against a specific job description. It leverages Google's Gemini generative AI to provide a quantitative match score, identify missing keywords, and offer actionable suggestions for improvement.

The Problem It Solves
Every job seeker faces the tedious and challenging task of tailoring their resume for each job application. Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) that automatically filter out resumes that don't match the job description's keywords. This tool automates the analysis process, helping you optimize your resume to pass these filters and catch the eye of recruiters.

‚ú® Key Features
Quantitative Match Score: Get an instant percentage score showing how well your resume aligns with the job description.

Missing Keyword Identification: See a list of crucial keywords and skills from the job description that are missing from your resume.

AI-Powered Suggestions: Receive concrete, rephrased bullet points generated by Google's Gemini AI to seamlessly integrate missing keywords and better showcase your experience.

File Support: Supports both .pdf and .docx resume formats.
